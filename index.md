## Gameplay

<!-- slide -->
The game starts off with each player spending their starting gold on recruiting units. 
Currently there are only two, but there are plans for several more and adding new units has been made easy.

<!-- slide data-background-video="Recruit_Units.m4v" -->

<!-- slide -->
Then each player gets to position their units on their side of the field.
Units can be selected either through the menue or by clicking on them.

<!-- slide -->
### The battle starts!

<!-- slide -->
Each unit has a set of actions, these actions are modular and can be added or removed during gameplay. They can be easly implemented by any unit.


<!-- slide -->
Every unit shares the End Turn action and the Wait action, which moves the units turn to the end of the turn cycle.

<!-- slide -->
Walking highlights the unit's movement range and lets the player decide where to go, from there the unit finds their path.

<!-- slide data-background-video="Unit_Walk.m4v" -->

<!-- slide -->
As you might have noticed, Kings issue out different commands for each action!

<!-- slide data-background-video="King_Commands.m4v" -->


<!-- slide -->
Certain actions, like the Wait action and Archer's ranged attack get disabled after moving! 

<!-- slide -->
## Archer!

<!-- slide -->
Archer's low movement range and health makes them helpless if anyone gets too close.

<!-- slide -->
The Archer has a strong ranged attack, letting you deal a lot of damage at a distance, but he's a bit paranoid. 
When an enemy unit gets close to him, he picks up his bow like a bat and gets ready to swing. In this state the archer attacks dealing minimal damage, therfore possitioning is key.

<!-- slide -->
## Knight!

<!-- slide -->
The Knight has a big movement range and more health, as well as a moderatly strong mellee attack. 

<!-- slide data-background-video="KnightAttack.m4v" -->

<!-- slide -->
Their special move is the Defend action, where they take a defensive stance for a turn. In this stance they gain a status effect which halves all incoming damage. However, mellee attacks spook them, dropping their guard.

### Battle isnt the only path to victory
If a player does not end their turn for a while, the crowd gets bored, and eventually upset, arming themselves with comically large tomatoes. They'll knock out the idle king, declairing their oponent as victor. 
Be careful though, at night their threshold for boredom is lower and the game must be played faster.

#### Plans for the future:
- Make proper pvp with a hosting server
- Add more units, actions, effects, maps, upgrades..
- Add PvE with roguelike elements, bossfights...
- Add the **chicken**
